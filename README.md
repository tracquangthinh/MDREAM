# MDREAM 

Monotherapy Drug Response prediction for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

A web application of MDREAM is publicly available at [MDREAM](https://www.meb.ki.se/shiny/truvu/MDREAM/).

To train MDREAM, you first need to download gene expression, drug response and mutation profiles of the BeatAML dataset [PMID: 30333627] 

`run.R` shows examples for the structure of the input and how to train MDREAM.

NOTE: MDREAM is for research use only, please do not use results of MDREAM for any practical medical treatment decisions.
